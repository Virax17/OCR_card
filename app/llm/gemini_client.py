BUSINESS_CARD_VISUAL_RULES = """
Business-card layout rules learned from local samples:
- First transcribe all readable printed text from each card side before choosing fields. Field values must come from that transcript.
- Treat the front side as the primary source for name, designation, company/business, email, website, and phone fields.
- The company/business name is usually the top-most stylized brand/logo text on the front side. It may be on the top-left or top-right, not necessarily in plain body text.
- Do not use branch names, office labels, building names, service-list headings, back-side product lists, slogans, or address landmarks as the company name.
- Back sides often contain branch addresses, support facilities, product photos, service outlines, target/safety slogans, and "we sell" lists. Use these for address/category support only unless a missing contact field is clearly printed there.
- Ignore QR codes, decorative icons, certification icons, product photos, separators, and handwritten notes unless the printed text beside them is part of a contact field.
- Person name is commonly the largest personal text block, often near the center/right, with designation directly below it.
- Never use a company/legal entity/brand as the person name. Legal suffixes and business words such as PT, Pvt, Ltd, LLC, Inc, Pte, Tbk, Co, Group, Engineering, Industrial, Services, Trading, Metal, Works, Radiator, Marine, Oil, Gas, or all-caps single-token brands are company clues, not person-name clues.
- If a line could be both a brand and a name, choose it as Business/company and return name as null unless there is a separate personal-name line near a designation.
- Designation is a role title such as Director, Procurement Manager, Plant Manager, Sales Engineer, Regional Sales Manager, or Quick Contact Specialist. Do not put company/service text into designation.
- Business is the company/legal entity/brand, such as PETROSEA, Babcock & Wilcox, TOKKI, PT Kezindo Sejahtera Abadi, PT. AIR SURYA RADIATOR, PT. Mechatechra Triasindo Indonesia, CESCO, or TIMAS SUPLINDO.
- Email may be preceded by E, Email, Mail, or an envelope icon. It must contain @ and a valid domain.
- Website may be preceded by W, Web, Website, a globe icon, or printed in the footer. It is a web/domain value, not the email address.
- Phone labels can be short: T/Telp/Tel/Phone for office, M/Mob/Mobile/HP/Cell for mobile, F/Fax for fax.
- Match the reference Excel format: Email1 is primary email, Email2 is secondary email, Contact1 is the main direct/mobile number, Contact2 is office/telephone, Contact3 is fax or another printed number.
- Contact1, Contact2, and Contact3 must be digits only with country calling code included when visible or inferable, for example 60133581918 or 912241266030. Do not include +, spaces, hyphens, or parentheses.
- For country_code, trust explicit phone prefixes like +62, +91, +971 before address guesses. Indonesia/Jakarta/Kalimantan/Papua/Sorong with +62 means country_code +62.
- If the card has multiple offices on the back, do not replace the front contact phone/mobile/email with back-side branch office numbers.

# The single most common extraction mistake is swapping/merging the person's
# name with the company/business name. This gets its own dedicated,
# step-by-step procedure (rather than folding it into the general rules
# above) because a short bullet list wasn't enough to stop the model from
# occasionally picking the brand line as the name or vice versa.
NAME_VS_COMPANY_PROCEDURE = """
Name vs. Business/Company — follow this procedure in order every time, because
mixing these two up is the most common mistake on this task:

Step 0. READ FIRST, CLASSIFY SECOND.
   Before assigning any field, read ALL lines on the card from top to bottom.
   Write out a mental list of every line and what it most likely represents
   (company brand, person name, job title, phone, email, address, etc.).
   Do NOT jump to conclusions from the first line — the person's name may
   appear below the company name, and a large word at the top is almost always
   a brand, not a person.

Step 1. List every distinct printed line on the front side (and back side only
if the front has no company line at all).

Step 2. Mark a line as a COMPANY candidate if ANY of the following is true:
   - It contains a legal-entity suffix or prefix: PT, Pvt, Ltd, LLC, Inc, LLP,
     Pte, Tbk, Sdn, Bhd, Co, Corp, Corporation, GmbH, S.A., S.p.A., B.V.
   - It contains a generic business noun: Group, Engineering, Industrial,
     Industries, Services, Solutions, Technologies, Systems, Trading, Supply,
     Manufacturing, Marine, Contractors, Oil, Gas, Energy, Construction,
     Logistics, Metal, Works, Radiator, Enterprises, Consultancy, Ventures.
   - It is the top-most stylized/logo text on the front side (brands are
     almost always at the very top, even a single stylized word like
     "PETROSEA" or "TOKKI").
   - It is repeated on the back side as a header/letterhead — a company name
     is the one constant across both sides; a person's name is not.

Step 3. Mark a line as a PERSON-NAME candidate if ALL of the following are
true:
   - It is 1-5 words, shaped like a human name (optionally with an honorific
     like Mr./Mrs./Ms./Dr./Ir./Prof. or post-nominal initials).
   - It contains NO legal-entity suffix and NO generic business noun from
     Step 2.
   - It sits directly above or below a designation/job-title line (Director,
     Manager, Engineer, Officer, Sales, Procurement, Founder, CEO, etc.), OR
     it is visually distinct in position/size from the top brand line.
   - It is not identical (ignoring case/spacing) to whatever line you already
     marked as the company in Step 2.

Step 3b. Mark a line as a DESIGNATION candidate if it reads like a job role:
   - Director, Manager, Engineer, Officer, Executive, President, CEO, COO,
     Founder, Consultant, Specialist, Coordinator, Supervisor, Analyst, Head,
     Procurement, Sales, Marketing, Operations, Technical, Regional, Senior,
     Junior, Assistant, Deputy, General Manager, Plant Manager, etc.
   - A designation is NEVER a company name, NEVER a person name by itself.
   - If a line contains BOTH a person name and a designation separated by a
     comma, dash, or slash (e.g. "Ahmad Rizal, Sales Manager"), split it:
     the human-name portion is `name`, the role portion is `designation`.
   - If a designation line appears ABOVE a name line, it is still a
     designation — do not promote it to the name field.

Step 4. Resolve conflicts — a line CANNOT be both:
   - If a line satisfies both Step 2 and Step 3 (rare), Step 2 always wins:
     treat it as the company, not the name. A stylized all-caps single word
     at the top of the card is a brand even if it superficially resembles a
     name.
   - If the only candidate for "name" is the same text as the company line,
     the card has no separate person name — return name = null. Do NOT copy
     the company name into the name field just to fill it in.
   - A line combining both on one row with a separator (e.g. "John Doe,
     Sales Manager" or "John Doe — Regional Manager") must be split: the part
     before the separator that reads as a human name is `name`, the part
     after is `designation`. Never leave the combined, unsplit text in either
     field.
   - An honorific prefix (Mr./Mrs./Ms./Dr./Ir./Prof./Haji) or post-nominal
     letters (e.g. "B.Eng", "M.T.") stay attached to the name line and do not
     disqualify it from being a person name.
   - DESIGNATION vs NAME confusion: if you are unsure whether a short text
     is a name or a job title, check if it contains a role keyword from
     Step 3b. If it does, it is a designation, not a name.

Step 5. Before finalizing, sanity-check both fields against each other:
   - `name` must never equal `business`/`company` (case-insensitively).
   - `designation` must never equal `name` or `business`/`company`.
   - `business`/`company` must never be a personal name with no legal suffix
     and no business noun and no top-of-card logo positioning — if nothing on
     the card qualifies as a company under Step 2, return business = null
     rather than guessing a person's name is the company.
   - Re-read the OCR lines one final time and confirm that each assigned field
     value is actually printed on the card as-is and is not a mix-up.
""".strip()


THINK_BEFORE_CLASSIFY = """
Before writing any JSON output, work through these reasoning steps internally:

REASONING STEP A — List all lines:
  For each line visible on the card (front then back), write: LINE: "<text>" → LIKELY ROLE: <company|name|designation|phone|email|address|other>

REASONING STEP B — Identify the company:
  Which line is the top-most brand/logo text? Does it contain a legal entity suffix or business noun?
  → Company = <that line>

REASONING STEP C — Identify the person name:
  Is there a line of 1-5 human-name-shaped words that is:
    (a) NOT the company line,
    (b) near a designation/job-title line (above or below it),
    (c) free of legal entity suffixes and business nouns?
  → Name = <that line>, or null if none qualifies.

REASONING STEP D — Identify the designation:
  Is there a job-role line (Director / Manager / Engineer / Officer / etc.)?
  Is it directly adjacent to the name candidate?
  → Designation = <that line>
  If a single line reads "Ahmad Rizal, Sales Manager", split it:
    Name = "Ahmad Rizal", Designation = "Sales Manager"

REASONING STEP E — Final sanity check before output:
  1. Name ≠ Company (if they match, set name = null)
  2. Designation ≠ Name and Designation ≠ Company
  3. Every field value must be a verbatim substring of the OCR text (except category/country)
  4. If you are uncertain about name or designation, add that field to uncertain_fields

Only after completing steps A–E, write the JSON output.

Look at the attached business card image(s) and extract structured contact fields

Rules:
{BUSINESS_CARD_VISUAL_RULES}
- Use only values visible on the card image. Do not invent missing values; prefer null over a guessed value.
- Every non-null field except category/country_code must be supported by a line in front_text/back_text.
- Never use service bullet text, marketing slogans, product names, or "Business Outline" headings as a person name or business name.
- front_text/back_text must contain the full transcription of that side, lines separated by "\\n"; back_text is null if no back image was provided.
- all_visible_text must combine front_text and back_text.
- field_evidence must be an object whose keys are field names and whose values are the exact transcript line(s) used for that field.
- uncertain_fields must be an array of field names you are not confident about.
- Contact1 is main direct/mobile, Contact2 is office/telephone, Contact3 is fax or another printed number — all digits only, with country calling code when visible or inferable.
- Country must be the full country name, not an ISO code (e.g. Indonesia, not ID).
- Category must be the single closest match to the company's business; never copy a job title or address into category.

Example — how to pick name vs. company from an annotated transcript:
Annotated OCR lines:
[front L0 | top | large] ACME INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY PTE LTD
[front L1 | top | small] Precision Engineering & Fabrication
[front L2 | middle | large] Tan Wei Ming
[front L3 | middle | normal] Regional Sales Manager
[front L4 | bottom | normal] M: +65 9123 4567  E: wei.ming@acme-industrial.com
Correct extraction: business="ACME INDUSTRIAL SUPPLY PTE LTD" (top brand line), name="Tan Wei Ming"
(large personal-name line, not the top brand, immediately above the designation),
designation="Regional Sales Manager". Do not swap these: the company is the legal-entity/brand
line even if it isn't the largest text, and the name is a personal-looking line distinct from it.

Negative example — company text must not become the name:
Annotated OCR lines:
[front L0 | top | large] TOKKI
[front L1 | middle | large] FITRI ALFIANA
[front L2 | middle | normal] Procurement Officer
Correct extraction: business="TOKKI", name="FITRI ALFIANA", designation="Procurement Officer".
Wrong extraction: name="TOKKI". A single all-caps brand token is a company/brand unless it is
clearly printed as a person's personal-name line.

Example — a combined name+title line must be split, not left merged or dropped:
Annotated OCR lines:
[front L0 | top | large] Babcock & Wilcox
[front L1 | middle | normal] John Doe, Regional Manager
[front L2 | bottom | normal] T: +91 22 4126 6030  E: john.doe@babcock.com
Correct extraction: business="Babcock & Wilcox", name="John Doe", designation="Regional Manager".
Wrong extraction: name="John Doe, Regional Manager" (unsplit) or name=null (dropped). Split on the
comma/dash separator: the human-name part is name, the role part is designation.

Example — honorific and post-nominal letters stay attached to the name:
Annotated OCR lines:
[front L0 | top | large] CESCO
[front L1 | middle | large] Ir. Bambang Suryanto, M.T.
[front L2 | middle | normal] Plant Manager
Correct extraction: business="CESCO", name="Ir. Bambang Suryanto, M.T.", designation="Plant Manager".
An honorific (Ir./Dr./Mr./Mrs./Prof./Haji) or post-nominal (M.T., B.Eng) does not disqualify a line
from being the name — do not strip it and do not mistake it for a business/legal suffix.

Example — an individual card with no company at all:
Annotated OCR lines:
[front L0 | middle | large] Priya Sharma
[front L1 | middle | normal] Independent Consultant
[front L2 | bottom | normal] M: +91 98765 43210  E: priya.sharma@gmail.com
Correct extraction: name="Priya Sharma", designation="Independent Consultant", business=null.
There is no legal-entity line or business noun anywhere on the card, so business must be null —
never promote the name or a generic title into the business/company field just to fill it in.

Return only valid JSON with these keys:
{", ".join(FIELDS)}

Rules:
{BUSINESS_CARD_VISUAL_RULES}
- The OCR text below is the only source of truth. Do not use outside knowledge.
- Do not invent missing values. Prefer null over a guessed value.
- Every non-null field except category/country_code must be supported by an exact OCR line.
- Preserve front_text and back_text exactly as supplied.
- Set all_visible_text to the combined OCR text.
- field_evidence must cite the exact OCR line(s) used for each non-null field.
- uncertain_fields must list fields where OCR is ambiguous or incomplete.
- Email fields must contain @.
- Website must be a printed website/domain value, not just the domain part of an email unless separately printed.
- If multiple domains are visible, choose the website whose domain is most similar to Business/company.
- If no separate website is printed, use the email domain as Website only when it clearly matches Business/company.
- Country must be the full country name, not ISO code. For example use Indonesia, not ID.
- Contact1 is main direct/mobile. Contact2 is office/telephone. Contact3 is fax or another printed number.
- Contact1, Contact2, and Contact3 must be digits only and include country calling code when visible or inferable.
- Business/company should be the top brand/company line from the front OCR text. If OCR missed the logo text, return null rather than guessing.
- Name is a PERSON's name, distinct from the business/company line, even when both appear near the top. A line tagged "large" near the top-middle or middle of the card that reads like a person's name (not a legal entity, not containing Pte/Ltd/PT/Inc/Co) is very likely the name. Do not put the company name into the name field, and do not put a person's name into business/company.
- A candidate is NOT a person name if it is the same text as Business/company, is a single all-caps brand/acronym, contains legal suffixes (PT/Pvt/Ltd/LLC/Inc/Pte/Tbk/Co), or contains business nouns such as Engineering, Industrial, Services, Trading, Metal, Works, Radiator, Marine, Oil, Gas, Group, Corporation. Put those lines in Business/company or return name=null.
- If no separate personal-name line is visible near a designation, return name=null. Never copy Business/company into name just to fill the field.
- Zip_code is ONLY the postal/PIN code printed as part of the address block (a short 4-8 digit code, e.g. a 6-digit Indian PIN or a 5-digit US ZIP). Never take a zip_code value from inside a phone number, mobile number, or fax number — those are longer digit runs typically preceded by phone labels (T/Tel/M/Mob/F/Fax) or a country code, and are not postal codes.
- Category must be exactly one of:
